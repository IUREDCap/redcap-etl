REDCap-ETL Configuration
========================

REDCap-ETL requires a configuration file. In addition, a REDCap
configuration project can also be used. Using a configuration project
allows users who do not have access to the REDCap-ETL server to set
some configuration properties and to start the ETL process.

If a configuration project is used, then REDCap-ETL will use the
configuration file to locate the configuration project, so in this case
the file needs to contain:

* the URL for your REDCap API
* the API token for your REDCap configuration project

The 3 main things that need to be specified in the configuration
are:

1. The data source - where the data is extracted from.
2. The transformation rules - how to transform the data in the data source
to the target for the data load.
3. The database - where the extracted and transformed data is loaded

Several properties can be specified in both the configuration file
and configuration project. For these properties, a non-blank value in the 
configuration project will replace the value in the configuration file
(which is read first).


Data Source
-----------------------------------
The data source is specified as the REDCap API token for the data project,
i.e., the REDCap project that has the data to be extracted.


Database
-----------------------------------

The database where the data is loaded is specified as a
database connection string. This string has the following format:

        <database-connection-type> : <database-connection-values>

Currently, the supported database connection types are

* **MySQL**
* **CSV** (comma-separated values).


### MySQL
For MySQL, the format of the database connection string is:

        MySQL:<host>:<username>:<password>:<database>

Example MySQL database connection strings:

        MySQL:localhost:etl_user:etl_password:etl_test_db

        MySQL:someplace.edu:admin:admin_password_123:etl_prod_db

### CSV
For CSV, the database connection string format is:

        CSV:<output-directory>

For example:

        CSV:/home/redcap-etl/csv/project1


Transformation Rules
---------------------------------------------------
The transformation rules specify how the records in REDCap should be transformed into records in your database. 


There are 3 choices for the source of the rules:

1. __text__ - rules are entered in a text box in the configuration project (not 
available for file-only configuration)
2. __file__ - the rules are stored in a file:
    * on the REDCap-ETL server, for file-based configuration
    * uploaded to the REDCap configuration project, for project-based configuration
3. __auto-generated__ - simple rules (one table per form) are automatically
generated by REDCap-ETL. Note that at this point, auto-generated rules are
intended for testing that an installation has been set up correctly, or to generate
an initial set of rules that are then modified.
The auto-generated rules will currently only produce good results for very simple cases.

To auto-generate rules so that they can be modified, use the following script:

    bin/transformation_rules_generator.php

The script uses a REDCap-ETL configuration file to
generate rules.
For example, from the top-level directory of the installation, you
could use the following command to generate rules for the
config/test.ini configuration file:

    php bin/transformation_rules_generator.php config/test.ini > config/test-rules.txt


Details about the transformation rules can be found here:
[Transformation Rules Guide](TransformationRulesGuide.md)


REDCap-ETL Configuration Properties
--------------------------------------
This section provides a detailed list of the configuration properties. The property names
here are the ones that are used in the configuration file and set in the configuration project.
